"The more failure that you've got,the better experience and learning you have. it's not about how many times you fail, what matters is you have to make your dreams into a reality. Keep your eyes on the prize. It's better to take chances in risky situations than to do nothing with it, The moment you gave up on your dreams is the moment you failed. Remember, nothing comes easy in achieving your dreams. Aim High ❤️",     6   ,8 months ago
